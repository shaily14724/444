# Student Grade Calculator

Welcome to the Student Grade Calculator! This simple web app helps you quickly calculate a student's total marks, grade, and pass/fail status for each subject—all in your browser.

## What Can You Do With This?

- **Enter Student Details:** Just type in the student's name and ID.
- **Input Grades:** Fill in marks for five subjects—Physics, Computer Network, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Digital Circuits & Systems. Each subject has 3 quizzes, 2 minors, and 1 major exam.
- **Instant Results:** Click **Calculate Grade** to see the total marks, overall grade, and whether the student passed each subject.
- **Easy Reset:** Made a mistake? Hit **Reset** to clear everything and start over.

## How to Use

1. Open [`https://shaily14724.github.io/Student-Grade-Calculator/`](https://shaily14724.github.io/Student-Grade-Calculator/) in your web browser.
2. Enter the student's name and ID.
3. Fill in the marks for each quiz, minor, and major exam.
4. Click **Calculate Grade** to see the results.
5. Click **Reset** to clear the form and results.

## How Grading Works

- **Grades:**
  - AAA: More than 450 marks
  - AA: 401–450 marks
  - A: 351–400 marks
  - B+: 301–350 marks
  - B: 251–300 marks
  - C: 201–250 marks
  - D: Exactly 200 marks
  - F: Less than 200 marks

- **Pass/Fail for Each Subject:**
  - You need more than 30 marks (but not over 100) in a subject to pass.
  - You must score more than 10 in the major exam for that subject.
